**10 minutes · demo, with hands-on steps**

The pipeline you are about to build - the gate sits **before** the push, so an

You have a hardened image, built on a base Docker **signed**, carrying attestations you
can verify. Nothing yet stops the next person merging a Dockerfile that undoes all of it -
so you will do two things: **verify** the trust chain by hand once, then turn that check
into a **gate** that runs on every push.

> Verification you run once by hand is theatre. The value only compounds when the check
> is a gate.

---

## Attest it

Hardened base images arrive with signed attestations from Docker. Yours carries
attestations too - you built `catalog-service:dhi` in Lab 2 with `--sbom` and
`--provenance=mode=max` - attached at build time and bound to the image **digest**.
Confirm they rode along, then push.

1. Tag and push to the local registry:

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker tag catalog-service:dhi registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
    ```

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker push registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
    ```

2. Ask Scout what is attested on that digest:

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker scout attest list registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
    ```

    An SBOM and SLSA provenance, both attached at build and bound to the digest you just
    pushed.

---

## Verify it

Presence is not trust - anyone can *attach* an SBOM. What makes it trustworthy is the
**signature** underneath it. Because you built on a Docker Hardened Image, the provenance
chain traces back to a base Docker **signed**, and you can verify that signature -
keyless, against Sigstore's transparency log. There is no key for you to manage; you
inherit and verify a signature from a builder you trust.

```bash terminal-id=build
docker scout attest get catalog-service:dhi --predicate-type https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2 --verify
```

The `--verify` flag is the whole point. `✓ Signature verified` means the provenance was
not forged and traces to a source commit you can open and read. **This is the image-signing
half of a secure pipeline - not a key you rotate, but a signature you *check*.** In a
moment you will make the pipeline check it for you, on every push.

---

## Now try to fool it

This is the most useful ninety seconds in the workshop.

Right now the `:dhi` tag points to the **attested** image you built in Lab 2 with `--sbom`
and `--provenance=mode=max`. You are about to play the attacker: overwrite that **same tag**
with a plain, unsigned rebuild and watch the provenance vanish. Same tag, different image -
that is the whole trick.

1. Rebuild with a **plain `docker build`** - no `--sbom`, no `--provenance`, unlike Lab 2 -
   and push it to the **same tag**. The `--no-cache` flag forces a fresh build, so the tag
   now resolves to a *different, unsigned* image - not the attested one it pointed at a
   moment ago:

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker build -t registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi --no-cache .
    ```

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker push registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
    ```

2. Ask for the attestations again - they are gone:

    ```bash terminal-id=build
    docker scout attest list registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Tags are mutable. Digests are not. Attestations and signatures bind to a digest.**
>
> Any process that trusts a tag - a Dockerfile that says `FROM node:24`, a manifest that
> says `image: catalog-service:latest` - is trusting that nobody moved it. The tag now
> resolves to a new digest with no SBOM, no provenance, and nothing that would survive a
> `--verify`: exactly the substitution an attacker performs, and the missing, unverifiable
> attestations are what give it away.

**Leave the tag like this.** The registry now holds an unsigned image where a verified one
used to be - a check you ran by hand caught it. In a moment you'll turn that same check into
a gate and watch your pipeline catch the *identical* substitution automatically, then fix it.

---

## Write the policy

You watched the default policy fail in Lab 1. That was an *evaluation* - a report you read.
Now make it a *gate*. A Docker Scout policy is just a list of pass/fail **rules**: each has a
`type` (what to check), its criteria, and an `action` - and `action: fail` means "block the
build if this rule is not met." Save this `docker-scout-policy.yaml` - three rules, one per
question from the spine (*is it safe*, *what is in it*, *where did it come from*):

```yaml save-as=docker-scout-policy.yaml
version: "1"          # policy schema version
policies:
  # Is it safe?  Fail the build if the image has any CRITICAL-severity CVE.
  - name: no-critical-cves
    type: vulnerability
    severity: critical
    action: fail

  # What is in it?  Fail unless an SBOM attestation is attached to the image.
  - name: require-sbom
    type: attestation
    attestation: sbom
    action: fail

  # Where did it come from?  Fail unless SLSA build provenance is attached.
  - name: require-provenance
    type: attestation
    attestation: slsa-provenance
    action: fail
```

Read top to bottom: **fail** if there is a critical CVE, **fail** if there is no SBOM,
**fail** if there is no provenance. An image passes the gate only when all three hold - which
is exactly why the hardened `:dhi` image clears it and the ungoverned `:baseline` does not.

Evaluate both images and compare:

```bash terminal-id=build
docker scout policy catalog-service:baseline --org $$org$$
```

```bash terminal-id=build
docker scout policy catalog-service:dhi --org $$org$$
```

One fails. One passes. You now know what the pipeline will say before you push.

---

## Put it in the pipeline

> [!NOTE]
> This is a **simulated** CI environment - `git.dockerlabs.xyz` is a stand-in, not a live
> server you log into. The workspace behaves as a Gitea repo whose `moby` account owns it:
> anything under `.gitea/workflows/` "runs" automatically when you push, and the run
> renders in the **CI Pipeline** tab at the top right - no browser needed.

**Gitea Actions** is Gitea's built-in CI - GitHub-Actions-compatible, so the workflow
below is the *same* YAML you would commit to GitHub. Here is what happens the moment you
push:

1. Create the workflow. It **verifies the signed attestations** already bound to the
   pushed digest, then runs the **policy gate** - and only a run that clears both
   **promotes** the image. The gate sits before the push, so a non-compliant image never
   reaches the registry:

    ```yaml save-as=.gitea/workflows/secure-build.yaml
    name: secure-build

    on: [push]

    env:
      IMAGE: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_REGISTRY }}/catalog-service:dhi

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # The by-hand `--verify` from earlier, now a gate. A tag rebuilt
          # without --sbom/--provenance has nothing to verify - this step fails.
          - name: Verify attestations
            uses: docker/scout-action@v1
            with:
              command: attestation
              image: ${{ env.IMAGE }}
              predicate-type: https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2
              # signature must trace to a trusted builder (keyless, Sigstore)

          # The gate sits BEFORE the push.
          - name: Policy gate
            uses: docker/scout-action@v1
            with:
              command: policy
              image: ${{ env.IMAGE }}
              organization: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_SCOUT_ORG }}
              exit-on: policy

          - name: Push
            run: docker push "$IMAGE"
    ```

2. Commit and push. The tag on the registry is **still the tampered, unsigned image** you
   left a moment ago - so watch this run go red:

    ```bash terminal-id=main
    git add .gitea/workflows/secure-build.yaml
    ```

    ```bash terminal-id=main
    git commit -m "Add secure build pipeline"
    ```

    ```bash terminal-id=main
    git push
    ```

Switch to the **CI Pipeline** tab. The run stops at **Verify attestations** - the digest
carries nothing to verify - and `Policy gate` and `Push` are skipped. The unsigned image
never reaches the registry. The `--verify` you ran once by hand is now enforced on every
push.

---

## Fix it, then re-run

The pipeline caught the substitution. Now fix the artifact - rebuild **with** attestations,
so a signed image sits on the tag again:

```bash terminal-id=build
docker build -t registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi --sbom=true --provenance=mode=max .
```

```bash terminal-id=build
docker push registry.dockerlabs.xyz/catalog-service:dhi
```

Back in the **CI Pipeline** tab, press **Re-run jobs** on the failed run. No new commit -
the *same* pipeline re-evaluates against the fixed tag, and this time every step is green:

- **Verify attestations** → SBOM + provenance present, signature verified ✓
- **Policy gate** → 3 / 3 policies satisfied ✓
- **Push** → image promoted to the registry ✓

> [!TIP]
> **Fix the state, re-run, green.** Re-run pushed nothing by hand - it re-evaluated the
> pipeline against the current state, and because a signed image now sits on the tag, the
> gate passed and the pipeline promoted it. That is the whole point of a gate: the same
> check runs on every push and every re-run, and nobody has to remember to run it.

---

## Checkpoint

- [ ] You have confirmed the SBOM and provenance attestations bound to the image digest
- [ ] You have verified the provenance signature (`--verify`) traces to a trusted builder
- [ ] You have watched the attestations vanish when the tag was moved
- [ ] You have evaluated the policy locally against both images
- [ ] You have watched the pipeline go **red** on the tampered tag in the CI Pipeline tab
- [ ] You have fixed the artifact and used **Re-run** to watch the same pipeline go green

## Four patterns that survive contact with a real team

1. **Gate on exploitable findings, not raw CVE counts.** This is what VEX bought you in
   Lab 1. Without it a strict gate is unusable and teams switch it off within a month.
2. **Require provenance to a *known builder*,** not merely provenance that exists.
3. **Separate base-image findings from application-layer findings.** Different owners,
   different remediation paths.
4. **Fail closed on missing or unverifiable attestations. Fail open with an alert on
   scanner availability.** A scanner outage should page somebody, not block every deploy.
