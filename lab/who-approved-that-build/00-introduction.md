# Who Approved That Build?

> At **02:47 AM** a commit lands. The author is `svc-build-agent` - not a person.
> It bumped a base image, regenerated the Dockerfile, and triggered a build. The
> reviewer? **CI approved it, all checks green.** No human said anything.

That is the question this lab answers - not *can* an agent do this (it can), but **how do
you govern it** so an agent-driven build clears the same bar a human's would. You'll do it
in four moves: **prove** what's in the artifact and where it came from, give the agent a
**governed baseline** to start from, and turn CI into a **signing + policy gate** that fails
closed - then push the whole fix left, into the agent's own build environment.

## Start at the finish line

Here is where this workshop ends: one application on a single, verifiable path from a
developer's prompt to production. Read it left to right.

<svg viewBox="0 0 900 250" width="100%" role="img" aria-label="The dev-to-prod path. On the left, a DEVELOPMENT zone wrapped in an sbx sandbox boundary: the agent authors in a sandbox querying the DHI MCP server before FROM, starts from a hardened base with 0 CVEs, builds with an SBOM and provenance, and signs keyless. In the middle, a CI gate that fails closed - the boundary to production. On the right, a PRODUCTION zone wrapped in a runtime box (read_only, cap_drop ALL, non-root): the signed image is deployed and invoked by an agent or MCP client with signed, read-only tools. Beneath the development zone, a red strip marks the ungoverned baseline: node:20 picked blind, 431 packages, no SBOM, running as root.">

On the left, **development**: an agent authors the image inside a sandbox it cannot
escape, starts from a hardened base, and emits an SBOM, provenance and a signature. In the
middle, a **CI gate that fails closed** - the boundary you cross to reach production. On the
right, **production**: only that signed, verified artifact runs, in a runtime box of its
own, invoked by agents that can reach only signed, read-only tools.

That is the finish line. **Now the start line - the red box.**

The application in this workspace is going to be containerised by an AI agent, not by you.

It is a Node.js **catalog** service - a frontend, a backend API, and a Postgres
database, talking to **Kafka**, **LocalStack** and **WireMock**. Right now it is just
source: no Dockerfile, no image. In a moment you will hand it to an agent with one
instruction - *containerise this for production* - and in about a minute it will choose a
base image, resolve several hundred packages, write a Dockerfile, and build successfully.
Nothing will fail. Nothing will warn.

What it ships is that red strip: `node:20` picked blind, 431 packages, no SBOM, running as
root, on your host. It *works*. You can prove nothing about it. Over the next ninety minutes
you close the gap between the red box and the road above - one stage at a time.

## What we mean by the stack

First, the phrase itself: "the stack" here is not the agent's reasoning, its prompts, or
its guardrails. It is your **container foundation** - the images your software is built
*on* and *from*. What agentic workflows changed is who decides. A system now makes three
calls about that foundation autonomously: it **pulls dependencies** into the image
(Lab 1), **builds the environment** from a base image it picked (Lab 2), and **invokes
tools** at runtime (Lab 4). Each is a point where trust used to pass through a human and
no longer does.

> Secure all three, then gate them on every push (Lab 3). That is the whole session.

## What changed

The software supply chain did not change. The review step did.

| Traditional workflow | Agentic workflow |
|---------------------|------------------|
| A developer picks a base image, with intent | An agent picks one, autonomously |
| Dependencies are reviewed in a pull request | Packages are resolved with no human review |
| CI runs configuration a human wrote | The agent wrote the Dockerfile |

> **The better the agent, the bigger the blast radius.**

The agent does not have to do anything *wrong* for this to be a problem. Suppose it
wrote an excellent Dockerfile - non-root, multi-stage, minimal. The vulnerabilities are
in the dependency tree either way, and you still cannot say where any of it came from.

## The three questions

Every tool in this workshop answers exactly one of these:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What is in it?** | SBOM |
| **Where did it come from?** | SLSA provenance |
| **Can you verify that claim?** | Signatures |

And a fourth, once you have the first three: *which of these vulnerabilities actually
affects me?* → **VEX**

## Your journey - walking the road, one stage at a time

Each lab is a stage on the dev-to-prod path above. You reach the finish line by fixing what
breaks at each stage - measured against the red baseline you start with.

| Stage on the road | Lab | What breaks here without it | What the catalog gains |
|-------------------|-----|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| The start line | - | The agent ships blind - no evidence at all | A measurement of the red box |
| **BUILD** | 1 | You cannot say what is in it or which findings matter | SBOM, VEX and provenance you can read |
| **BASE** | 2 | CVEs accumulate from a base nobody chose | **A hardened base - the pivot** |
| **SIGN + GATE** | 3 | Nothing stops the next merge undoing all of it | A verified signature and a gate that fails closed |
| **DEVELOP** (+ INVOKE) | 4 | The fix only ever happens *after* the agent ships | A sandbox and the DHI MCP server - the fix moved to authoring time |

**Lab 2 is the centre of gravity.** Lab 1 teaches you to measure an image. Lab 2 is
where the measurement pays off, and every number you wrote down changes. **Lab 4 then moves
the whole fix left** - to development - so a well-boxed agent reaches the same result on its
own, and the red box never happens in the first place.

## What you are working with

You will be working with the Product Catalog service: a `frontend/` (React), a `src/`
backend (a REST API over a PostgreSQL product database, talking to Kafka, LocalStack (S3)
and WireMock), and the database schema in `db/`. There is no Dockerfile and no compose
file yet - the agent writes those next.

Continue to **Setup**.
